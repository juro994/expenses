# Expenses
This is going to be a multi-tier (n-tier) Spring application for managing my expenses. This is the first bigger project I'm intending to present on GitHub, therefore I will be using technologies, approaches and stack that I'm familiar with:

* Java 11
* Spring Boot
* MySQL database
* Maven
* RESTful APIs
* Frontend in Typescript, using either React or Vue (with an electron version in place)

***
The project is still under development.
